Major Changes:

* Support websocket connections. See
https://github.com/grapenut/websockclient for a sample in-browser
client. [Grapenut, 1007]
* Change attributes from being stored in sorted linked lists to sorted
arrays; results in faster lookups and less memory usage. [SW]

Minor Changes:

* Message translation support now defaults to off. Run configure with [1m--enable-nls[0m to turn it on if needed. [SW]
* Shrink the [1mNEW_PE_INFO[0m struct, for signficant memory savings in softcode that queues lots of commands. [SW]

Softcode:

* Support all of Rhost's [1mcolors()[0m key arguments (Except n). [SW, 1112]
* Functions that work on integers (Like [1mdiv()[0m or [1mband()[0m) now use 64-bit values instead of 32-bit. [SW]
* [1mjson_query()[0m get and exists can follow paths into objects instead of taking a single key/index. Suggested by qa'toq. [SW]
* [1mjson_query(str, unescape)[0m handles unicode escape sequences.
* [1mjson(string, foo)[0m escapes non-ascii characters.
* [1mclone()[0m now takes an optional fourth argument to act like [1m@clone/preserve[0m [797]

Fixes:

* A bunch of color names weren't mapping correctly to Xterm color codes. [SW]
* [1m@grep/iprint[0m hilites the matching text in the same case it appears in the attribute body. [SW, 1120]
* [1m@mail[0m wasn't updating a player's MAILCURF attribute correctly. [CLDawes, 1131]
* Connecting with a web browser to a mush without a [1mmud_url[0m config option set caused an infinite refresh loop. Reported by grapenut. [1149]
* Make sure [1msigrecv_ack()[0m won't hang the mush if it somehow gets called at the wrong time. Also fix a file descriptor leak in the signal handling code. [SW]
* Pass [1mpe_info[0m into IDLE and HAVEN attributes from the page command. [MG]
* The x and X options to [1malign()[0m now always truncate to the column width, rather than incorrectly truncating at a space. Reported by Qon. [MG, 1178]
* [1mjson_query()[0m didn't understand an action of 'type' as documented. [SW]
* Assorted help file fixes. [SW]
* [1m@clone[0m without /preserve wasn't stripping privleged flags and such. [1190,SW]

Documentation:

* Changelogs and other documentation use markup. [SW, 1140]
* Start trying to clean up and revise ancient documentation. [1095]

OS Specific:

BSDs in general:

* [1minfo_slave[0m and [1mssl_slave[0m use [1mkqueue()[0m to efficiently be notified of parent mush crashes.

OpenBSD:

* netmush and slave processes use [1mpledge(2)[0m to limit their privileges. [SW]

Windows:

* Use Windows crypto library functions for base64 conversion and digest hashing instead of OpenSSL. [SW]
